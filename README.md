<!-- About this dashboard.  To be filled out by Malcolm and Vanessa -->

## Contributing

To contribute to this project, please create a new branch for your changes and make a pull request. One easy way to do this from within R is with the `usethis` package and the `pr_*` functions. `pr_init("branch-name")` begins a new branch locally, `pr_push()` helps you create a new pull request, and after it is merged you can use `pr_finish()` to clean things up. More about this workflow [here](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html).

### `renv`

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for package management. When opening this repo as an RStudio Project for the first time, `renv` should automatically install itself and prompt you to run `renv::restore()` to install all package dependencies.

### Shiny app structure

The content and layout of the dashboard is defined in `app/app.R`.  Custom functions used (e.g. to create plots) follow the form `gsi_*()` and are defined in scripts in the `app/R/` directory.

To learn more about Shiny and the `bslib` package (used to define the UI of the dashboard), see these resources:

- [Welcome to Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html)
- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)
- [`bslib`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/index.html)

### Modifying plot theme

The theme for all of the `ggplot2` plots in the dashboard is controlled by `R/0-theme_gsi.R`.
(the filename starts with '0' because the files are sourced alphabetically and the theme is used by all the other functions in `R/`).

## Deployment
<!-- aspirational: 
This app is published to <https://viz.datascience.arizona.edu/gsi-dashboard/> automatically by a GitHub action whenever changes are made to the main branch of this repository.
If changes are not being reflected on the deployed app or there are other issues with the live app, please contact \@cct-datascience.
